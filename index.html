<h1 align = "center"> About Me </h1>

Hi, my name is Andrew Taylor. I am currently a PhD candidate in Control &
Dynamical Systems at Caltech, advised by
<a href="http://ames.caltech.edu/", style = "color:blue;">Professor Aaron Ames</a>,
and am currently on the job market. I study safety-critical control under uncertainty,
predominantly for robotic systems. My research has focused on unifying rigorous
methods from  <b>nonlinear control theory </b> with recent advances in
<b>convex optimization</b> and <b>machine learning</b> to produce
robust control designs that I can validate on real-world robotic platforms.
If you are interested in discussing my research, or work opportunities, feel free
to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:ajtaylor@caltech.edu", style = "color:blue; font-family:courier;">ajtaylor@caltech.edu</a>.
